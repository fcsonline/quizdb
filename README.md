# QuizDB

_A personal dynamic flash cards_

A graph database (Ex: Neo4j) with stored information about whatever topic. It
can be books, authors, movies, etc. After having everything stored on it, you
can ask predefined questions with Cypher. Those questions can be the base for
some kind of Flashing cards and implement [Spaced
repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). Those questions
can be easy like *Who is the guy in this picture?* or they can be difficult
like *Who born on 1960 and filmed Magnolia?* and extreme questions *Who born the
same year as Terminator was presented?*

The idea is that every user can have their own databases, like Anki decks or
the can reuse some existing public databases.

**Tecnologies:** Neo4j, GraphQL and React
